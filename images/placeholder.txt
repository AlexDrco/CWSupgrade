This file is a placeholder for carousel images.

For the carousel to work correctly, you must:

1. Create images with names "imagen1.jpg", "imagen2.jpg", etc. for each day
2. Place them in the corresponding folders:
   - images/dia1/
   - images/dia2/
   - images/dia3/
   - etc.

You can include up to 10 images per day. The system will automatically display all images it finds.
